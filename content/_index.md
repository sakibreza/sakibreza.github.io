I am a second-year PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), jointly advised by [Dr. Mohsen Moghaddam](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/moghaddam-mohsen/) (AI/XR) and [Dr. Octavia Camps](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/camps-octavia/) (Computer Vision). My research focuses on the fascinating convergence of **Computer Vision** üé• and **Human-AI collaboration** ü§ù within the realm of **Mixed Reality** ü•Ω. Specifically, I am dedicated to developing cutting-edge methods for egocentric activity understanding from multi-modal data. These methods will contribute to the creation of intelligent mixed reality systems that assist and guide humans in various tasks. 
<!-- Prior to joining Northeastern, I gained valuable industry experience at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/). Additionally, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at [KUET](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/) in Bangladesh. -->

I am actively seeking collaboration and internship opportunities in the fields of Computer Vision and Intelligent Mixed Reality. Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:reza.s@northeastern.edu)!
