I am a PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), specializing in Computer Vision and Intelligent Extended Reality. Under the guidance of [Dr. Octavia Camps](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/camps-octavia/) (Computer Vision) and [Dr. Mohsen Moghaddam](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/moghaddam-mohsen/) (AI/XR), my research is focused on advancing video understanding, multimodal egocentric perception, and video-language models.

My current PhD project centers on developing multimodal egocentric perception capabilities for mixed reality applications, particularly in understanding user actions and activities within task-oriented scenarios. This work aims to create intelligent mixed reality systems that enhance human capabilities by providing context-aware guidance and support across various tasks.

I am actively seeking collaboration and internship opportunities in Computer Vision and Intelligent Mixed Reality. Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:reza.s@northeastern.edu)!

My research focuses on the fascinating convergence of **Computer Vision** 🎥 and **Human-AI collaboration** 🤝 within the realm of **Mixed Reality** 🥽. Specifically, I am dedicated to developing cutting-edge methods for egocentric activity understanding from multi-modal data. These methods will contribute to the creation of intelligent mixed reality systems that assist and guide humans in various tasks. 
<!-- Prior to joining Northeastern, I gained valuable industry experience at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/). Additionally, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at [KUET](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/) in Bangladesh. -->
